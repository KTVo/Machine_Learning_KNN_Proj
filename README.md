# Machine_Learning_KNN_Proj
Description:   This assignment will used the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm to classify existing breast tumors as malignant or benign based on a data set that was gathered from the source below. In this case, we'll use vales from the mean_smoothness, mean_texture, and radius from the given data set. Within this data set, most of the values will be used as the training set were some will be extracted to only be used a the testing set.
